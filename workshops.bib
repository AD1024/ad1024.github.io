	abstract = {Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve more than 90{\%} accuracy on popular benchmarks such as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding1, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. Here, in response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be an expert-level closed-ended academic benchmark with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 2,500 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable but cannot be quickly answered by internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a marked gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.},

    abstract = {Formal specifications are essential for reasoning about the correctness of complex systems. While recent advances have explored automatically learning such specifications, the challenge of distinguishing meaningful, non-trivial specifications from a vast and noisy pool of learned candidates remains largely open. In this position paper, we present an approach for specification ranking, aimed at identifying the most critical specifications that contribute to overall system correctness. To this end, we develop a four-metric rating framework that quantifies the importance of a specification. Our approach leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models to rank specifications from a set of automatically learned candidates. We evaluate the proposed method on a set of specifications inferred for 11 open-source and 3 proprietary distributed system benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in ranking critical specifications.},
